# GPT-Text-Sanitizer

This Python script, inspired by my frequent interactions with AI services like ChatGPT, automates the process of removing star symbols ('*') from text files. Often, when copying text generated by AI models like ChatGPT, it includes stars in the headings, which can be bothersome to remove manually, especially for lengthy texts. This script aims to streamline the process by allowing users to quickly remove stars from their text files.

## Usage

1. **Input Text File**: Paste your text into the file named `input_text.txt`.
2. **Run Script**: Execute the Python script `main.py`.
3. **Output Text File**: Retrieve the modified text from the file named `output_text.txt`.

## Instructions

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Follow the usage instructions mentioned above.
- Modify the script or files as needed for your use case.
